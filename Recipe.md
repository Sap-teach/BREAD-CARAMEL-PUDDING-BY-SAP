                                                 This is a recipe for Caramel Pudding(Veg)

Hi!
1)Take 500ml of milk and heat it until its steaming hot.. Then keep it to cool down for 10 minutes under normal room temperature.
2)Take 3 breads and grind them in the mixer with some water.You will obtain a thick mixture.
Also put 5 tablespoonfull of sugar in the mixture and heat it..
3)Then mix the milk with the thick mixture thoroughly and add another 5 tablespoonfull of sugar..(You may become diabetic after having this pudding, XD)
4)Then put 2 teaspoon of vanilla essence to the mixture. If you want you can also add some yellow food color.
5)Then put the mixture in a cylindrical bowl  which has a cover on it.
6)On the other hand take 8 tablespoonfull of sugar, put it in a nonstick pan and add 2 teaspoons of water and heat the it until the sugar turns golden brown.
7)Now you have to be quick. You quickly pour this caramel mixture on the top of the pudding mixture which you prepared and put inside the bowl.
8) Spread the caramel evenly on the top of the previous mixture and cover the bowl and tightly pack with a rope.
9)Inside a pressure cooker, take water until 1/4 of the cooker's height and then add some salt to it.
10)Put a bowlstand (I hope what I am trying to tell coz I don't know the name of that chakki type of thing, XD) inside the water and on that put the bowl gently in which there's that mixture you prepared.
11)Now on medium-high flame, put the pressure cooker for 35-40 mins and then let it cool for 1 hour by submerging the cooker in cold water..
12)Take out the bowl from the cooker once it's cool..
13)Submerge the bowl in very cold water for 3 minutes and then take a plate and turn over the bowl and take out the prepared pudding.
14)If it doesn't come out, take a spoon and beat the sides of the bowl continuously and it will eventually come out.
15)Refrigerate the pudding for 2 hours and voila you'll get some freaking delicious Caramel Pudding.
